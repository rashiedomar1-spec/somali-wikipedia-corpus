History traitor: Cumar (A.A.A.) Samatar.
Omar Samatar was born between 1880 and 1884 in the Alula district of the Bari region of Somalia. He served as the inaugural commander of the pro-imperialist militia organized by Ali Yusuf Kenadid, who was aligned with Italian interests.The Italians equipped Kenadid with modern weaponry, including 1,000 specialized muskets from Oman, to assist in subduing Somali clans that resisted Italian influences. Kenadid appointed Omar Samatar as the first leader of his forces, and they established their base in Hobyo. Both Kenadid and Samatar committed to expanding their territory into the interior regions to facilitate Italian assimilations into that land, notable the Ex Mudug area. For a while, the Italians maintained control over the coastal territories. In late 1922, following the overthrow of the Italian Empire by Benito Mussolini, new military governors were appointed to oversee Italy's protectorates, including Libya, Italian Somaliland, and Eritrea. Mussolini implemented a revised policy regarding Italian imperial territories, which led to the new decision of the Italian Somaliland millitary governor to cease providing weapons and financial support to pro-Italian warlords like Ali Kenadid. Angered by this decision, Kenadid's military commander, Omar Samatar, retaliated by killing Lieutenant Sprontelli in the Elbur area of the Mudug region. The fascist authorities in Italian Somaliland responded with outrage to the assassination of their official, issuing arrest warrants for both Mr. Kenadid and Samatar. This created an opportunity for local clans to engage in scores of assaults on the Ali Khadid Militia, resulting in assassinations and targeting attacks of Kenadid's militia. Notable commanders such as Godegode and Gusha were among those who fell in the Elbur area. As a result, Omar Samatar's militia faced increasing challenges, contending with both the desire for revenge from marginalized clans and the pressure from the new Italian fascist regime to apprehend him. By the end of 1925, Italian forces launched an assault on the Hobyo garrison, leading to its destruction. Ali Kenadid was captured and subsequently imprisoned in Mogadishu, where he later succumbed to tuberculosis.Samatar and a small contingent of guards retreated to the Dollo Area. In January 1926, remnants of the Darvesh received news that their former pro-Itallian Malitia commander had sought refuge in their territory following an ambush; nine of Samatar’s guards were killed, but he managed to survive. He continued his journey to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he surrendered to King Menelik of the Ethiopian Empire. There, he demonstrated his loyalty to the kingdom and was subsequently appointed as an adviser to the king. At that time, Menelik was engaged in a campaign to expand his empire into Somali territories and was at long war with the Darvesh Sufis, led by Jihadist Muhammad Abdulle Hassan. Since then, Omar Samatar has been collaborating with King Menelik, who held the belief that the Somali people were an integral part of a greater Ethiopia. Omar Samatar passed away in Ethiopia, specifically in Addis Ababa, in 1961.
